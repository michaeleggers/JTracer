# JTracer
Black and White Raytracer written in Java for a study project at the University of Applied Sciences Munich

***About***
This project was created in collaboration with my colleague Vithya Jeyachandran as a project for a class at MUAS. The raytracer reads in simple text files (scenes) that will get parsed. The program is capable of rendering spheres and planes (represented by a equation) with multiple lightsources and reflections.
